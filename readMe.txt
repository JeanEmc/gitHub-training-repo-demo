This is the collaboration branch for valerie. 

The collaboration branches are also sometimes referred to as feature branches or topic branches in some models.  They are typically created from integration branches or perhaps other collaboration branches, and they typically merge back into the branch from which they were created.  They are areas where developers can collaborate on changes.  Developers may create collaboration branches as needed in their domain forks without requiring any special permission.  By default, collaboration branches are not restricted.  If the development team using a collaboration branch desires extra configuration of the branch, such as to make it a protected branch or to add other infrastructure, the team should make the request of the domain fork managers.  Collaboration branches are the equivalent of AccuRev stream pairs below domain streams, or shared user streams.
